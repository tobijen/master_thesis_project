Given a query and a expert profile, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 3 with the following meanings:
0 = represent that the expert has nothing to do with the query, 
1 = represents that the expert seems related to the query but does not answer it, 
2 = represents that the expert has some answer for the query, but the answer may be a bit unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous information and 
3 = represents that the expert is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer.

Important Instruction: Assign category 1 if the expert is somewhat related to the topic but not completely, category 2 if expert presents something very important related to the entire topic but also has some extra information and category 3 if the expert only and entirely refers to the topic. If none of the above satisfies give it category 0.

Query: {query}
Expert: {expert}

Split this problem into steps:
Consider the underlying intent of the search.
Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M).
Measure how trustworthy the expert is (T).
Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O). Final score must be an integer value only.
Do not provide any code in result. Provide each score in the format of: ##final score: score without providing any reasoning.
